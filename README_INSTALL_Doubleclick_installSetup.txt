To participate in Multiplayer games on Grhin's or Krarilotus Multiplayer Streams, this setup will guide you through the setup process!

Preparations:
I.)   Install Stronghold Crusader Extreme v1.41 on your computer. The location where you install the game to is now called "installation folder"
II.)  If you happen to have an old version, please use this HD patch, before installing any further mods (like UCP), and follow its instructions:
      http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com/patch.html
III.) Make sure to move your installation folder to a location with full write access.
      What that means is, that you don't want to have your folder in some location like Programs (x86) or Program Files,
	  but in a location like D:\Stronghold Crusader HD\

Steps:
0.)   unzip the .zip file in your installation folder.
1.)   Make sure, the folder UCP-BootstrapMultiplayer (or GRhin-setup) is directly inside the installation folder of Stronghold Crusader v1.41
2.)   Go into that folder and doubleclick on installSetup.bat, now wait for the black box to appear and disappear
      -> if the black window stays open after showing an error, type delete and press enter.
3.)   Download GameRanger if you haven't already and create an account
4.)   In the GameRanger main window, go to Edit->Options and select Stronghold Crusader Extreme,
      then you Browse and select your installed Stronghold_Crusader_Extreme.exe inside your installation folder
	 
Enjoy :D You'll now be able to participate in the Bootstrap Multiplayer Games, just hop into a GameRanger room and Go!
Make sure to update your Multiplayer Setup whenever a new version comes out!
