# Changelog

v1.10.3

The setup changes the gameplay to what's much more comparable to actual RTS games, with the idea of gradual unit/economy progression, by:
- Vastly changing the starting conditions
- Using a custom map pack
- Fixing tons of bugs and adding QoL features
- Revamping the balances to what seemed to be FireFly's original intentions

The style has no artificial rules.
Of course, the usual ban on general bug abuses and external programs, giving the player an unfair advantage, is still in place.

## Starting Changes
The vanilla game's multiplayer's biggest issue is the min. 2k gold start, either promoting early rushing or enforcing some amount of "No Rush" timer to be set - as a result of which, most people end up playing with a fully scripted economy and macro strategy, since it is the most efficient way of playing.

We have gotten rid of this by changing the starting resources to 0 gold, 100 wood and 100 bread, as well as removing starting units, so the player can choose their own in form of mercenaries.
The setup still has multiple starting setting choices, with reasonable resource/unit levels, for AI games or in case it's needed in general.
The game will also default to 50 speed, as that is what most players prefer to use.

## Maps
Another issue with vanilla multiplayer is its maps - the vanilla ones are inherently poorly laid out and unbalanced, the custom ones being very simplictic, complimentary to the scripted style most players end up playing.

We have our own map pack, consisting of over 50 custom made maps specifically for the style, varied for all kinds of playstyles.

## Bug Fixes
Yet another issue with vanilla multiplayer, or vanilla in general is its bugs.

The setup uses the [UCP](https://unofficialcrusaderpatch.github.io/), including most of its bugfixes, QoL features and a custom AI pack, making them much stronger and allowing for map specific uses.

## Custom Graphics
The vanilla game has a few issues and bugs in its graphics.

The setup includes a custom graphics pack with bugfixes and improvements, which can optionally be installed after the main setup.

## Rebalance Changes
Probably the most glaring issue in vanilla is its poor unit/economy balances.

The setup uses a rebalance mod with custom configuration, making vast majority of units and buildings viable, for their respective uses.
